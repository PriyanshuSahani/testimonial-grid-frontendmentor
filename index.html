              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

  did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
  100% recommend! ”
